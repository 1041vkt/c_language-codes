---------------------
basic
input/output
control statement
loop statement
jump statement
nested for loop
array
nd array
string
function
union
structure
pointer
recursion

Basic:
-------
1) #: preprocessor directive

2) include: is a folder name which contain header file.

3) header file: header file which predefine function and extension of header file is .h .
   like stdio.h,dos.h,conio.h etc. 

4) stdio: standard input output .which contain printf(),scanf() etc.

5) conio: console input output. which contain clrscr(),getch()...etc.

6) void: void is a no return type or null return type.void always used in no return type function.

7)main(): main is a function used for start execution of program and end execution of program.

8) int a,b,add :
--------------------
this is known as variables.
variables: variable is a memory space holder used to hold variable space.
we can change value of variable in execution time.

constant: constant also a memory space holder but we can not change value execution time. 
constant value always fixed.

Restriction for declare variables :
-----------------------------------------------
1)variable should be start with characters not digits.
Ex :
int 123;------------false
int abc;.................true

2) special chareacter are not allowed in variables :
Ex: int % ,$ ,#;------------false

3) space are not allowed in variable we can use underscore in variables.
___________________________________________________________
Ex :  int my name;------------------false
       int my_name;---------------------true

printf() :
_____________
printf() is a formatted function available in stdio.h header file.
used to dislay output or any messages.

scanf() :
________
scanf() is used for input data according to datatype with formate specifire.
scanf also known as input function in c language also available in stdio.h header files.

add = a+b;
_________
here add a,b is a operands and =,+ is a operator.

Operator:
________
operator is a symbol used to perform relation two or more operands.

Types of operator:
___________________
1)Arithmatic operator :
___________________
+addition  - substraction * multiplication / devide
% reminder operator

2)Logical operator :
_________________
&&(and) : is used for checked both condition are true.
||(or) : is used when single or both condition are true.
|(not) : is used when true then false . and when false then true.

3)Relational operator :
_________________
> , < , >= , <=  is used for relational operators.

4)Assignment operator :
_______________________
=  , += , -= , *= , /= used to assign value right hand side to left hand side.

5)Equality operator :
______________________ 
 ==   is used for compaare left hand side value to right hand side value.

5)Incerment/Decrement operator :
______________________________
++  +1  is increment operator.
 --   -1   is decrement operator.

7)Conditional operator/Ternary operator :
__________________________________
?  ,  :   is used for condiotnal or ternary operator.
 
8)Bitwise operator :
________________
&  |  ^  .  ~   work with binary operations.


what is c programming:
_____________________
c programming is a mother language.
mother language means most popular language like python,c++,java and C# these are all based on c language.
Most popular opareration system Linux and unix these all based on c language.

c also known structure based programming language.

c++ is also a extended version of c language.

Before c language algol b , bcpl language came in 1965 to 1968 after that in 1969. 
Sir Dennis Ritchie developed a programming language 
known as  c language in AT and T bell lab in USA .
c also known as high level , low level and assembly level programming laguage.
c language is pure case sensitive language.

what is compiler :
________________
compiler which convert source code to machine code.
compiler is a  also known as translator.
compiler execute all code at a time.

what is  interpreter :
____________________
Interpreter also a translator and compile source code line by line.

what is keyword :
_______________
keyword is a reserve word and we can not declare any variable  
or constant same name os keyword.
32 keyword are used in c programming.

format specifire :
_________________
formate specifire tells about data type and symbols;

integer                     int                      %d
decimal                   float                    %f
character                char                    %c
string                       string                  %s
long int                    long                    %ld
long float double   %lf              ........etc

Data flow control:
------------------------
1)control statement:
---------------------------
control statement is used for control block of codes based on condition.
i)simple if
____________
if statement:
___________
if is a keyword used in control staement for check single condition. if condition are true then block of code
will be executed.

Syntax:
__________
if(condition)
{
//block of codes;
}

ladder if statement :
__________________
else if keyword are used in ladder if. ladder if used when multiple condition are
checked. condition checked one by one after thet else block will be executed.

syntax:
___________
if (condition 1) 
{
// statement 1;
}
else if(condition 2)
{
// statement 2;
}
.
.
else
{
//statement;
}

nested if :
__________
nested if contain condition inside another condition.
when outer condition is true then inner condition is executed.
otherwise else block will be executed.

Syntax:
__________
if (condition)
{
                       if(condition)
	  {
	 //statement; 
	}
	else
	{
	//statement;
	}
}
else
{
	if (condition)
	{
	//statement;
	}
	else
	{
	//statement;
	}
}

else:
________
when if condition is false then else block will be executed.

Syntsx:
______
if(condition)
{
//statement;
}
else
{
//statement;
}
 
ii)switch:
____________

switch is a keyword used in control statement.
switch statement contain break ,case and default keywords.
case is used for condition.
break is used for stop forcefully execution thre code.
if all case condition are fase then default block will be executed.

Syntax:
___________
switch(var_name)
{
case1:
//statement;
break;
case 2:
//statement;
break;
.
.
.
}

2) Loop statement:
________________
loop staement is used for execute block of code repeatadly until given condition are true.

/or

for(initilization;condition;updation)
{
//condition;
}



2)Exit control loop:
__________________
i) do-while loop:
_______________
do-while is a exit control loop. do is a keyword.
In this concept compulsary code execute once.

Syntax:

 String :
__________

String is a Collection of  array.
String also used index 0 to lenght-1.
In C language no any string are not used
In C we used char data type for string. 
for using predefined function of string ,we used string.h header file.

 Syntax :
_________
char variable_name[size]

predefine function in string:
__________________________
1: gets( ) :
------------- gets is used for input in string.

2: getch( )
---------------getch function is used for uer input .but given value only one character. character is not visible.

3. getche( ):
------------------this function is always used for user input but given value only one character .character is always visible. 

4. getchar( ):
---------------------this function is used for user input .given input string .but read only one character .

5. strelen( ) :
---------------this function is used for find lenght of string . this functio store in string.h header file.
